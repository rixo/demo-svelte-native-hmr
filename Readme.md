# DEPRECATED

Official [svelte-native-template](https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native-template) has added HMR support so this demo won't be maintained anymore. It was doing nothing more than that.

Use the official template for HMR demo.

HMR support for Svelte Native is still an ongoing effort. Feel free to report any issue (or mere feedback) you have regarding HMR at [my fork of svelte-loader](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-loader/issues).
